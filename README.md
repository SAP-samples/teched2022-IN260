# IN260 - Achieve Exactly-Once Semantics in Apache Kafka Using SAP Integration Suite

## Description

Learn how to build an end-to-end event-driven integration scenario where you react and respond to business events using Apache Kafka and SAP Integration Suite to deliver and process a message at the receiver system exactly once.  

## Overview

This session introduces attendees to new features that have been recently shipped in the Cloud Integration capability of SAP Integration Suite via an end-to-end integration scenario. In particular, we focus on the Kafka adapter to be able to implement pub/sub scenarios and new flow steps such as the idempotent process call that allows you to implement Exactly Once message delivery.

Check out the following chapters to understand the overall integration scenario that is handled in this exercise:

- [Scenario Introduction](intro/intro1)
- [New hire event configuration in SAP SuccessFactors (for your information only)](intro/intro2)
- [Pre-deployed Integration Flow to publish events to Confluent Kafka (for your information only)](intro/intro3)

## Requirements

There are no prior requirements to this exercise. You can perform this even if you do not have any experience with integration platform from SAP. However, you will be able to derive increased value from this session if you have some knowledge on what SAP Integration Suite is all about and how it helps with enterprise-wide integration needs.

You can check out this SAP Discovery Center mission that will help you in getting started with SAP Integration Suite:

## System logon & user information

For running through the exercises, we will provide access to the following systems:
- SAP SuccessFactors system
- SAP Integration Suite tenant
- Confluent Kafka system
- SAP Process Automation

User and password information will be provided to you by the instructors.

When you run through the exercise steps, you need to ensure that the technical IDs of the integration artifacts that you will create are unique. Hence, add a participant number to your integration artifacts. The participant number will be assigned to you by the instructors.
