# Exercise 4.4 - Check the Process Automation inbox

In the following, you will recheck you Task Center(one inbox) as the hiring manager.

## Exercise steps

Run through the following steps
1. Open [SAP Build Process Automation Inbox](https://teched-2022-in260-tk4694cz.sap-process-automation.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com/comsapspaprocessautomation.comsapspainbox/inbox.html). The login id and password will be provided by the hands-on session moderators.

2. This time around, the Hire Event has been replayed and as a manager you will not be expected to repeat the steps of assigning equipment or training to your new hire. You should find no task waiting for your action.
