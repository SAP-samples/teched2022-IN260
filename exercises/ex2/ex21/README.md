9. To have enough space for modeling the integration flow steps, we will rearrange and resize the components. First, select the *Receiver* box and place it below the main process pool.
10. Then, select the right edge of the *Integration Process* box and pull it further right to make the box wider
11. Finally, drag and drop the *End Message* event further right so that the whole integration flow stub looks like in the picture below
